# ðŸ“„ Position Model Specification

**Purpose:**  
This document defines the structure of the **Position** model in the Trading Journal Web App.  
A position tracks a userâ€™s open holdings in a specific trading Symbol (e.g., BTC/USDT), including size, average entry, and realized PnL.

|------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`             | `string` | Unique identifier (UUID or ObjectId)                                |
| `userId`         | `string` | Reference to the user who owns the position                         |
| `symbolId`       | `string` | Reference to the trading symbol from the **Symbol** model             |
| `totalQuantity`  | `number` | Current quantity held in the position                               |
| `averageBuyPrice`| `number` | Weighted average price of all buys                                  |
| `realizedPnL`    | `number` | Total realized profit/loss from any partial or full sells           |
| `closedAt`       | `string` (ISO timestamp) | Timestamp when the position was fully closed (optional) |
| `createdAt`      | `string` (ISO timestamp) | Timestamp when the position was opened                  |
| `updatedAt`      | `string` (ISO timestamp) | Timestamp when the position was last updated            |

## ðŸ“Œ Behavioral Notes

- A position record **only exists for open positions**.
- When `totalQuantity` becomes **zero**, the system should:
  - Set `closedAt` to the current timestamp.
  - Keep the record for historical tracking (do not delete).
- `realizedPnL` updates as partial or full quantities are sold.
- Multiple trades contribute to the `averageBuyPrice`.

## ðŸ”„ Relationships

- `userId` â†’ references a **User**
- `symbolId` â†’ references a **Pair** model (trading pair metadata)
