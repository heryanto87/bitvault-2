- `positionId` â†’ references a **Position**
- `symbolId` â†’ references a **Symbol**

## ðŸ“Œ Behavioral Notes

- `buy` trades increase the `totalQuantity` and adjust `averageBuyPrice` in the associated Position.
- `sell` trades reduce the `totalQuantity` and calculate `realizedPnL` accordingly.
- The `fee` is stored in quote currency (e.g., USDT if trading BTC/USDT).
- Trade timestamps align with system conventions (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
