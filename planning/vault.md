## ðŸ§® Constraints & Business Logic

- `profitShareRatio` must be an integer between **1** and **99**.
  - If the value is `60`, the trader earns **60%** of the profits, and the investors share the remaining **40%**.
- `payoutCycle` defines how often profit distributions occur â€” in full-month intervals.
- Only users with role `trader` can create and manage vaults.

## ðŸ”„ Relationships

- `userId` â†’ references a **User** (must have role: `trader`)
- Vaults may be linked with:
  - Deposits made by investors
  - Trades executed by the trader
  - Performance and payout history
